# RPGItems SweetRice Fork

The RPGItems2 plugin continued from [TheCreeperOfRedstone/RPG-Items-2](https://github.com/TheCreeperOfRedstone/RPG-Items-2)

LangUtils is needed and no longer need to install NyaaCore.

## Fork

This is a personal fork. I add [LoreUpdateEvent](/src/main/java/think/rpgitems/event/LoreUpdateEvent.java) so it is friendly to *SoulBinding-kind* plugins. 
```grovvy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'top.mrxiaom:rpgitems:3.10-c985dd:all'
}

```
I uploaded it to central. It is easy to depend it. :P

## What's new 

* LoreUpdateEvent
* Gradient color support
* More friendly and developer comfortably help command
* More friendly Chinese translation with color

## Accessible

We **will** publish the functional update and bug fixing. We **WON'T** publish the powers, triggers and conditions made by us. They are packaged into an extension in our server.
